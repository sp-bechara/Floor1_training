Networking Layer:

OSI Model(Open source interconnection)

Two points to be remembered for OSI model:
1) It is having 7 layers architecture, each layer having specific functionality.
2) All this layers works collaboratively to transmit data from one network to another network across globe.

Layers:
1) Application
2) Presentation
3) Session
4) Transport
5) Network
6) Data link
7) Physical

Application Layer:
It enables user to network resources.

services offered:
1-File transfer and access management.
2-Mail services
3-Directory services

Presentation layer:
It is concerned with syntax and sematics of the info exchange between two systems.

services offered:
1-Translation
2-Encryption
3-Compression

Session layer:
It establishes, maintain and synchronized the interaction between two connecting devices.

services offered:
1-Dailog control i.e. half duplex or full duplex
2-synchronization

Transport layer:
It is responsible for process to process delivery of entire message.

services offered:
1-Port addressing
2-Segmentation and reassembly
3-Connection control
4-End to end flow control
5-error control

Network layer:
It is responsible for delivery of data from source network to destination network.

services offered:
1-Logical Addressing i.e. IP addressing
2-Routing

Data link layer:
It is responsible for moving data(frames) from one node to another node.

services offered:
1-framing
2-Physical Addressing
3-Flow control
4-error control
4-access control

Physical layer:
It is responsible for transmitting bits over a medium.It also provide electrical and mechanical specification.

services offered:
1-Physical characteristic of the media.
2-Representation of bits.
3-Data rate
4-synchronization of bits
5-line configuration
